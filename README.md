# 🗺️ Wendy's Portfolio



Welcome! This space gathers a selection of my work as a Geospatial Analyst and Remote Sensing Specialist, focused on conservation, sustainable development, and humanitarian contexts.

Each project reflects my commitment to using spatial data for actionable insights — and to doing so with clarity, creativity, and reproducibility.

## 🌱 Conservation & Land Use Projects

| Project | Description | Tools | Visual Outputs |
|--------|-------------|-------|----------------|
| [`Strategic mapping for páramo conservation`](./guardianas-paramo) | Multitemporal land cover and land use analysis (2000–2024) in the Pisba páramo. Identified land use conflicts and priority areas for conservation and economic transformation. | ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, Adobe Illustrator | Maps for policy and community use, technical report |
| [`Ecological monitoring of regenerative tourism interventions`](./ndvi-sar-modeling) | Developed a reproducible methodology using NDVI and SAR-based spatial regression models (SAR) to evaluate ecological impact over time—strengthening the monitoring and adaptive management of a regenerative tourism program. (USAID - Destino Naturaleza) | Python (GeoPandas, rasterio, NumPy, matplotlib), Jupyter | Reproducible notebook, graphs of vegetation trends, spatial regression outputs |

## 🌍 Humanitarian & Social Research

| Project | Description | Tools | Visual Outputs |
|--------|-------------|-------|----------------|
