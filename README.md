# 🗺️ Wendy's Portfolio



Welcome! This space gathers a selection of my work as a Geospatial Analyst and Remote Sensing Specialist, focused on conservation, sustainable development, and humanitarian contexts.

Each project reflects my commitment to using spatial data for actionable insights — and to doing so with clarity, creativity, and reproducibility.

## 🌱 Conservation & Land Use Projects

Project | Description | Tools | Visual Outputs
Strategic mapping for páramo conservation | Multitemporal land cover and land use analysis (2000–2024) in the Pisba páramo. Identified land use conflicts and priority areas for conservation and economic transformation. | ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, Adobe Illustrator | Technical report, thematic and cadastral maps for community participants
Ecological monitoring of regenerative tourism interventions | Developed a reproducible methodology using NDVI and SAR-based spatial regression models (SAR) to evaluate ecological impact over time—strengthening the monitoring and adaptive management of a regenerative tourism program. (USAID - Destino Naturaleza) | Python (GeoPandas, rasterio, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn) | Reproducible notebook, graphs of vegetation trends, spatial regression outputs

## 🌍 Humanitarian & Social Research

Project | Description | Tools | Visual Outputs
Targeting strategies for vulnerable migrant populations | Identified intervention clusters based on settlement patterns of vulnerable migrant populations. Supported strategic planning and collaboration routes for socio-economic integration services. | ArcGIS Pro, Stata, SAS, Power BI, KoboToolbox, ArcGIS Online | Strategic maps, dashboards, infographics, MEL visuals
violence-lgbti-analysis | Spatial analysis of violence against LGBTI persons in Colombia. Explored correlations with multidimensional poverty indicators and early warnings. | ArcGIS Pro, R, Stata | Statistical and thematic maps, analytical report
Socio-environmental assessment of riverbed modifications | Multitemporal evaluation of the influence of socioeconomic dynamics on water bodies. Supported legal and environmental research. | ArcGIS Pro, Office, GPS | Thematic maps, exploratory data analysis outputs
