# 📍 Geospatial Portfolio — Wendy

Welcome! This space gathers a selection of my work as a Geospatial Analyst and Remote Sensing Specialist, focused on conservation, sustainable development, and humanitarian contexts.

Each project reflects my commitment to using spatial data for actionable insights — and to doing so with clarity, creativity, and reproducibility.

> _"Always under construction — just like good code (and good ideas)."_

## 🌱 Conservation & Land Use Projects

Projects that support land cover analysis, biodiversity conservation, and ecosystem management.

- [`guardianas-paramo`](./guardianas-paramo): Multitemporal analysis of land use in the Pisba páramo (2000–2024) and mapping of conservation-priority zones.
- [`ndvi-sar-modeling`](./ndvi-sar-modeling): Regression modeling of NDVI using SAR to evaluate vegetation changes in conservation interventions (USAID - Destino Naturaleza).


## 🌍 Humanitarian & Social Research

Geospatial support for social programs and equity-based initiatives.

- [`migrant-cluster-analysis`](./migrant-cluster-analysis): Identification of settlement patterns and service access gaps for vulnerable migrant populations (USAID - VRI).
- [`violence-lgbti-analysis`](./violence-lgbti-analysis): Spatial analysis of violence against LGBTI persons in Colombia and correlation with socio-economic indicators.


## 🛠️ Tools & Automation

Reproducible workflows, code automation and data cleaning pipelines.

- [`geo-automation-python`](./geo-automation-python): Python scripts for raster processing and land cover classification.
- [`data-cleaning-workflows`](./data-cleaning-workflows): Tools for transforming, georeferencing and visualizing complex datasets.


## 🗺️ Maps & Visual Storytelling

Cartographic pieces and visual materials created for reports, community engagement and decision-making.

- [`infographics-dashboard`](./infographics-dashboard): Web maps, dashboards and static graphics for institutional reports and strategic communication.
- [`community-maps`](./community-maps): Map products designed for field teams and participants, ensuring accessibility and clarity of spatial information.
