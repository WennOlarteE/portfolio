# 🗺️ Wendy's Portfolio



Welcome! This space gathers a selection of my work as a Geospatial Analyst and Remote Sensing Specialist, focused on conservation, sustainable development, and humanitarian contexts.

Each project reflects my commitment to using spatial data for actionable insights — and to doing so with clarity, creativity, and reproducibility.
