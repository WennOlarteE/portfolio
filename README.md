# üó∫Ô∏è Wendy's Portfolio



Welcome! This space gathers a selection of my work as a Geospatial Analyst and Remote Sensing Specialist, focused on conservation, sustainable development, and humanitarian contexts.

Each project reflects my commitment to using spatial data for actionable insights ‚Äî and to doing so with clarity, creativity, and reproducibility.
