# 🗺️ Wendy's Portfolio



Welcome! This space gathers a selection of my work as a Geospatial Analyst and Remote Sensing Specialist, focused on conservation, sustainable development, and humanitarian contexts.

Each project reflects my commitment to using spatial data for actionable insights — and to doing so with clarity, creativity, and reproducibility.

> _"Always under construction — just like good code (and good ideas)."_

## 🌱 Conservation & Land Use Projects

| Project | Description | Tools | Visual Outputs |
|--------|-------------|-------|----------------|
| [`Monitoring ecological change in regenerative tourism sites`](./ndvi-sar-modeling) | Developed a reproducible methodology using NDVI and SAR-based spatial regression models (SAR) to evaluate ecological impact over time—strengthening the monitoring and adaptive management of a regenerative tourism program. (USAID - Destino Naturaleza) | Python (GeoPandas, rasterio, NumPy, matplotlib), Jupyter | Reproducible notebook, graphs of vegetation trends, spatial regression outputs |
| [`Strategic land use mapping in páramo ecosystems`](./guardianas-paramo) | Multitemporal land cover and land use analysis (2000–2024) in the Pisba páramo. Identified land use conflicts and priority areas for conservation and economic transformation. | ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, Adobe Illustrator | Maps for policy and community use, technical report |


## 🌍 Humanitarian & Social Research

| Project | Description | Tools | Visual Outputs |
|--------|-------------|-------|----------------|
| [`Spatial clustering for migrant vulnerability targeting`](./migrant-cluster-analysis) | Identified intervention clusters based on settlement patterns of vulnerable migrant populations. Supported strategic planning and collaboration routes for socio-economic integration services. | ArcGIS Pro, Power BI, KoboToolbox | Strategic maps, dashboards, infographics, MEL visuals |
| [`Spatial patterns of violence against LGBT+ populations`](./violence-lgbti-analysis) | Spatial analysis of violence against LGBTI persons in Colombia. Explored correlations with multidimensional poverty indicators and early warnings. | ArcGIS, R, Stata | Statistical and thematic maps |
| [`Socio-environmental analysis of riverbed transformations`](./violence-lgbti-analysis) | Multitemporal evaluation of the influence of socioeconomic dynamics on water bodies. Supported legal and environmental research.| ArcGIS Pro, Office, GPS | Thematic maps, exploratory data analysis outputs |
