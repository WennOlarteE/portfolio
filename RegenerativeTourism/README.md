Context Review & Data Gathering\n- Defined relevant timeframes for the baseline, intervention period, and program completion.\n- Downloaded monthly PlanetScope imagery and normalized scenes for each target corridor.\n- Created seamless image mosaics by stitching together adjacent satellite tiles with high spatial overlap.\n\n#### 2. Delimitation of Study Areas\n- Clipped mosaics using corridor-specific shapefiles.\n- Masked out urban and aquatic areas to focus exclusively on vegetated land.\n\n#### 3. NDVI Calculation\n- Calculated the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for each monthly mosaic:\n - High values = healthy/dense vegetation \n - Low values = bare soil or water\n\n#### 4. Exploratory Statistical Analysis\n- Extracted key NDVI metrics per pixel and at corridor scale:\n - Max/Min (vegetation extremes) \n - Mean/Median (central tendency) \n - 90th Percentile (best conditions)\n- Created visualizations:\n - Thematic NDVI maps (monthly)\n - Histograms to understand value distributions\n - Time series of key statistics per corridor\n\n#### 5. Annual Processing & Spatial Modeling\n- Temporal integration:\n - Averaged NDVI across months to obtain annual composites\n - Standardized spatial resolution for year-to-year comparison\n- Spatial regression:\n - Applied SAR models to quantify annual ecological change\n - Detected spatial patterns and clusters of improvement or decline\n- Visual outputs:\n - Annual difference heatmaps\n - Boxplots comparing key statistics across years\n - Spatial autocorrelation plots\n\n---\n\n### ⚙️ Tools & Technologies\nPython (GeoPandas, rasterio, NumPy, matplotlib) · QGIS · Jupyter Notebook\n\n---\n\n### 📊 Outputs\n- Reproducible code and documented methodology in a Jupyter Notebook.\n- Visualizations of vegetation health trends per site.\n- Spatial regression maps to support program monitoring and decision-making.\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 Key Takeaways\n- Combining NDVI with spatial regression created a nuanced, credible picture of ecological dynamics.\n- Spatial modeling revealed not only if change happened, but where — critical for adaptive planning.\n- The workflow is scalable and adaptable to other nature-based interventions.\n\n---\n\nWant to take a look at the code or visuals?
