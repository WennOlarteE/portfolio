Monitoring ecological change in regenerative tourism sites

Ecological monitoring of regenerative tourism interventions
📅 Date
2023

🏢 Organization
Patrimonio Natural, with support from USAID – Destino Naturaleza

🎯 Objectives
Evaluate the ecological impact of regenerative tourism initiatives supported by the Destino Naturaleza program.

Develop a spatial methodology to monitor vegetation trends and identify ecological improvements over time.

Strengthen evidence-based decision-making for adaptive management of nature-based tourism projects.

🛤️ Methodological Approach
Context Review & Data Gathering

Collected multisource remote sensing data (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2).

Defined key sites for monitoring based on project interventions.

Indicator Construction

Calculated NDVI and SAR-based metrics to model vegetation dynamics.

Performed time-series analysis to compare pre- and post-intervention periods.

Spatial Analysis & Interpretation

Applied spatial regression techniques to detect ecological patterns.

Identified zones with significant vegetation changes aligned with tourism interventions.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies
Python (GeoPandas, rasterio, NumPy, matplotlib), QGIS, Jupyter Notebook

📊 Outputs
Reproducible code and methodology in a Jupyter Notebook.

Graphs of vegetation trends by intervention site.

Spatial regression maps and visualizations to support decision-making.

🔍 Key Takeaways
The integration of NDVI and SAR data allowed for a robust and nuanced assessment of ecological changes.

Spatial modeling proved essential for validating and communicating the program’s impact on local ecosystems.

The workflow is scalable and adaptable to other regions or types of nature-based interventions.
